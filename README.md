# 🚀 Web Development Journey – Projects Repository

This repository documents my **complete web development learning journey** through **hands-on projects**.  
After every major concept or learning milestone, I build a **small, focused project** and commit it here.

The goal is simple: **learn → apply → commit → improve**.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Track my **progress as a web developer**
- Convert **theory into practical implementation**
- Build a **strong foundation through mini-projects**
- Maintain **consistent GitHub activity**
- Create a **portfolio-ready codebase** over time

This repo is **not a single application**, but a **collection of independent projects** created during learning.
